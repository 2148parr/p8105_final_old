**The tentative project title:**

**The motivation for this project:** We have an increasingly aging
population

**The intended final products:**

-   Written report
-   Webpage that includes an “about” section, a dashboard page that
    includes visualizations and exploratory statistical analyses
-   A 2-minute narrated screencast that illustrates our project

**The anticipated data sources:** National Health and Aging Trends Study
from Johns Hopkin’s and Westat

**The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:**

*Outcomes*: Emotional well-being, Risk of depression using the PHQ
depression scale

*Tentative predictors and covariates*: Social network, home environment
(ex. mobility / assitive devices), physical capacity (ability to walk,
lift, etc.), cognitive assessment (memory, at risk for dementia),
driving and transportation, assistance with ADLs, demographic variables
(age, race, education) - initial answers in round 1.

We would also like to visualize how the association between predictor(s)
and outcomes change over time.
